# Iris Recognition System

This repository contains an Iris Recognition System developed using Python 3.10 and the Django framework for the backend. The system leverages a Siamese Neural Network architecture with pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically VGG16 and ResNet50, to extract features from segmented and normalized iris images. The project includes a web interface that enables users to upload images and access hidden files securely using iris-based biometric authentication.

## Overview

The Iris Recognition System is designed to perform similarity learning for iris recognition, utilizing a Siamese Neural Network. This architecture is ideal for comparing pairs of iris images to determine if they belong to the same individual. The system integrates segmentation and normalization functions, a trained model for feature extraction, and a Django-based backend to serve a secure web application.

## Dataset

The project uses the IITD dataset, which includes eye images from 224 individuals. The dataset is organized into folders labeled by person ID (001â€“224), containing grayscale images of left, right, or both eyes. Through data augmentation techniques, approximately 20,000 image pairs were generated to train and evaluate the model.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Python Virtual Environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10:
     ```bash
     python3.10 -m venv venv
     ```

2. **Installation:**
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate  # for Unix/Linux
     venv\Scripts\activate     # for Windows
     ```
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Running the Backend:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Apply migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
   - Start the Django server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

4. **Training Your Own Model:**
   - Train the model as per the instructions in the `report` folder.
   - Replace the trained weights by naming them `current.h5` and `.keras` and placing them in `backend/backend`.

## Implementation Details

- **Architecture**: The system employs a Siamese Neural Network with pre-trained VGG16 and ResNet50 CNNs for feature extraction. The segmentation and normalization functions are implemented in `backend/core/utils.py`, while the model is defined in `backend/backend/utils.py`.
- **Segmentation**: For detailed segmentation functionalities, refer to the [Segmentation Repository](https://github.com/itmaybehimm/segmentation).
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive details on the architecture, methodologies, and results are available in the `report` folder.
- **Predictions**: Example predictions can be viewed in `images/prediction.webp`.
